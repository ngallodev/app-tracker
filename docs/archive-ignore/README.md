# Archive Ignore

This folder stores historical planning, review, and handoff artifacts that are not part of the active execution path.

- `planning/`: legacy day-by-day plans and imported planning drafts
- `review-checklists/`: older checklist handoff packs
- `root-notes/`: notes moved out of repository root to reduce noise

For active work tracking, use `docs/WORKBOARD.md`.
