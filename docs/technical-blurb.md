# Technical Blurb

This app is a full-stack job application tracker centered on deterministic-first resume-to-job analysis: a .NET 10 Minimal API (`Tracker.Api`) with EF Core + SQLite stores jobs, resumes, analyses, and step-level LLM logs, then runs a pipeline that hashes normalized JD/resume text for cache reuse, performs LLM-assisted JD extraction, applies deterministic gap matching, and only falls back to LLM gap analysis when confidence is low; it exposes CRUD + analysis endpoints with rate limiting and input-validation middleware, returns coverage/groundedness plus token/latency metadata, includes a fixture-driven deterministic eval runner (`Tracker.Eval`) for repeatable quality checks, and ships a lightweight React/Vite frontend that currently lists jobs and resumes from the API.
